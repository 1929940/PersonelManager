//TODO LIST

1. Requests should return data wrapped in a class

	ResponseWrapper<T>

	string StatusCode
	string Message
	T Payload


Perhaps add some logo
Add Colours Blue-Grey?

7. CONSIDER ENSURING SUCCESS ON EVERY ENDPOINT IN COMMUNICATION LIBRARY

9. ADD SHOW ONLY ACTIVE {BOOL} TO VIEWS

10. Foreman has MAIL while Users have EMAIL - need to unify this

11. BUFOR - ADD and DELETE in the same session just adds. 
	- Need to check if object is in bufor
	- If so need to apply changes to it

	-If added then deleted - remove from bufor all together
	-If added then modified - change the added item

	-basically need to detect and optimilize duplicates

12. Dialogboxes - make em inform the user about changes being saved on saving employee?
				Or just no msg box there...
