	User creates contract, sets its period, total value, hourly value.
	When the contract is is in progress User adds advances.
	Advances check if they can be given.
	Advances are submited, and then realized.
	When the contract is over, the user is able to create payment.
	Contracts can be closed early?
	Once payment is paid, close the contract.

	User can:
		-see all contracts			DONE																						
		-see all active contracts	DONE
		-filter via box				DONE
		-see whose contract is this	DONE
		-see contract value (Brutto or netto?)
